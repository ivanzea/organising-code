## Exercise 1: Importing

#### Goal

Get comfortable with different ways of importing objects from a package. 



#### Tasks

0. [if not done already] clone the repository



1. Importing the module `brew_potions.py`  in the `example_usage_outside_package.py` file: 

   1. import only the `make_example_potion` function
   2. import all the objects in the module
   3. change the import statement so that you can call the `make_example_potion` function like this: `br.make_example_potion`

   

2. In the `scritps` folder, there is a file called `example_usage_different_folder.py`. Trye to import the   `make_example_potion` function from there. 
   1. does it work?
   2. If yes, why? If no, why not?
