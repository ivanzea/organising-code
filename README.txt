The package is part of a lecture on
• organising
• documenting 
• distributing code

 A README can explain in detail what the package does and/or how to use it i.e. how to install it / install an environment. 

A README file can be written in reStructuredText or Markdown.

Please keep in mind that in those regards, this is not a very helpful README (yet).

Good luck!
